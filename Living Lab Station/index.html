<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/p9lDxiv.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Living Lab Station, formerly known as the High-End Sensors,  is aimed at providing the Living Labs with a system for monitoring the performance of their interventions. The Station aims at providing a solution that can be used by the Living Labs not just from a scientific point of view but also as a tool to engage local communities on air pollution related issues.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/QB5P4r9.jpg" /></p>
<p>The station is designed with a modular principle where sensors can be added easily added expanding the capabilities of the installation or replaced when they are damaged or the sensors lifetime is over. From a costs perspective while being more expensive than the Citizen Kit it is also conceived as a low-cost solution. That allows to guarantee at least four stations will be available for each Living Lab to increase the spatial resolution and reliability of the measurements.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HUq7Anz.jpg" /></p>
<p>The design builds on top of the Citizen Kit adding an extra set of more accurate sensors especially aimed at measuring air pollutants. The sensors include the Gas Sensor Board, featuring EC Carbon Monoxide, Dioxide Nitrogen and Ozone sensors and the PM Sensor Board, featuring a PM 2.5 / PM 10 sensor.</p>
<p>With all the sensor together this Kit provides information on Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, Ambient Light, Barometric Pressure, Particles Matter (PM 2.5 / 10),  Carbon Monoxide, Dioxide Nitrogen and Ozone. The sensors are later described in detail in the document at the Sensor Components section.</p>

<p>The sensors are already assembled and <strong>we strongly require to not swap</strong> any of the sensors among them. </p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>We keep track internally of all sensor deployments and it is very important not to swap the internal components between Station to avoid mismatchs on the calibration data.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Step by step</p>
<p>You have to follow some simple <strong>steps</strong> to setup your SCK to capture data and store it on an SD card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the 3 protective stickers covering the Gas Sensors.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/rIJvRva.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the small allen key to unscrew the 3 screw on top.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/v86gjW6.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the top cover</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/WesxBTl.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the big allen to remove the 3 screw.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/pNRaoVQ.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Pull the cover out.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/7wxWP68.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the <strong>SD card</strong> is inserted in the kit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EqCErGS.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the <strong>battery</strong> to your SCK. The led should turn <strong>pink</strong> indicating SD card logging. The SCK will try to start immediately, but since the clock is not yet configured it will blink for 5 seconds and the led will turn <strong>red</strong> (setup mode).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/z4HcfuF.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/o8V3bb4.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Syncronize the <strong>RTC</strong> (Real Time Clock) of the SCK with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC time</a>. The simplest way of doing this is to join to your SCK WiFi network:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With your computer or smartphone search for a wifi network named <strong><em>SmartCitizenXXXX</em></strong> (The exact name should come in a sticker in the back of your kit).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/lTYtmCZ.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you join the network a <strong><em>Network Login</em></strong> screen should appear, if this doesn't happen open your browser and type <strong>192.168.1.1</strong> as the URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to <strong><em>SD Card Mode</em></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/MqN8t0m.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the time it's sync the led should turn <strong>pink</strong> again and your sensor will start logging data to the SD card.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/dwXZGMz.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img alt="👏" class="emojione" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f44f.svg" title=":clap:" /> Congratulations! You are ready close the enclosure and start capturing data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The configuration of enabled/disabled sensors is stored on the SDcard so <strong>the cards shouldn't be swaped between kits.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="💻" class="emojione" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f4bb.svg" title=":computer:" />  If you have problems with a SD Card be sure to format it with <em>FAT32</em> filesystem and don't copy any configuration file before inserting it on the kit, the kit will re-save the last valid configuration on the new sdcard.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Done for today? Turn off</p>
<p>Every time you want to stop the Kit from logging simply press the button for 5 seconds. The led should stop bliking and your Kit will be <em>OFF</em>. To turn it <em>ON</em> simply press the button again.</p>

<h3 id="sensor-considerations">Sensor considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#sensor-considerations" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p><strong>Electrochemical sensor</strong></p>
<p>The electrochemical sensors <strong>need stabilisation time under the testing conditions</strong> they will be at. It is important to set and power the sensors with sufficient time (1-2 days) on the test environment for them to adapt. The newer the sensor, the more stabilisation time it requires. For this deployment, you will be receiving brand new sensors.</p>
<p>Humidity and temperature extremes will require of further sensor adaptation, in order to dry out or absorb the necessary humidity for their proper functioning.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Do not extract/attach the sensor capsule from the base board while powered, this could irreversibly damage the sensor.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Particle Sensor</strong></p>
<p>The particle sensors measurements are delivered as averages of the two sensors with periodic validity checks. We are currently developing one-shot strategies for battery life improvement, but in the meantime, please make sure the sensor has reliable energy supply if you will use these sensors permanently.</p>
<h3 id="sensor-data-processing">Sensor data processing<a class="headerlink" href="#sensor-data-processing" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>We have developed an algorithm that ingests the data from either the platform or the local csv and processes electrochemical sensor sensor data. This algorithm is <strong>in validation stage</strong> and will be included in the online platform flow from Smart Citizen once validated.</p>

<p>The Station can be directly powered at 220V AC (Consumption MAX 33W).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Batteries</p>
<p>The Living Lab Station has a higher consumption, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors.</p>
<p>That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power.</p>
<p><em>For example, we can connect the station on the street light electric line, so the Station gets charged during the night when the lights are on.</em></p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Solar Panel</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the PV Solar Panel system to power the Station independently. The system is currently under tests, and it will be available in the next few months.</p>

<p>When the Station is working on batteries the led will be <strong>on</strong> only when reading sensors or saving data. The rest of the time it will show a <strong>little blink</strong> every 2 seconds as a heartbeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On low battery (less than 10%) the led will do a <strong>triple orange blink</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Station is connected and charging the battery it will do a little <strong>orange</strong> blink every two seconds. When the battery is fully charged (or no battery is connected) this blink will turn <strong>green.</strong></p>

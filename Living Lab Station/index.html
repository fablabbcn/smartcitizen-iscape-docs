<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/p9lDxiv.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Living Lab Station, formerly known as the High-End Sensors, is aimed at providing the Living Labs with a system for monitoring the performance of their interventions. The Station aims at providing a solution that can be used by the Living Labs not just from a scientific point of view but also as a tool to engage local communities on air pollution related issues.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/QB5P4r9.jpg" /></p>
<p>The station is designed with a modular principle where sensors can be added easily added expanding the capabilities of the installation or replaced when they are damaged or the sensors lifetime is over. From a costs perspective while being more expensive than the Citizen Kit it is also conceived as a low-cost solution. That allows to guarantee at least four stations will be available for each Living Lab to increase the spatial resolution and reliability of the measurements.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HUq7Anz.jpg" /></p>
<p>The design builds on top of the Citizen Kit adding an extra set of more accurate sensors especially aimed at measuring air pollutants. The sensors include the Gas Sensor Board, featuring EC Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone sensors and the PM Sensor Board, featuring a PM 2.5 / PM 10 sensor.</p>
<p>With all the sensor together this Kit provides information on Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, Ambient Light, Barometric Pressure, Particles Matter (PM 2.5 / 10),  Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone. The sensors are later described in detail in the document at the Sensor Components section.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components<a class="headerlink" href="#components" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The Living Labs Station is a modular system based on different sensor board that connected to a central datalogger.</p>

<p>The station operates as a platform where new sensor modules can be shipped and deployed by the Living Labs themselves when they are finished enabling faster iterations and upgrades even after the project finishes.</p>

<p>The electrochemical sensors <strong>need stabilisation time under the testing conditions</strong> they will be at. It is important to set and power the sensors with sufficient time (minimum 4-5 days for new sensors) on the test environment for them to adapt. The newer the sensor, the more stabilisation time it requires. For this deployment, you will be receiving brand new sensors.</p>
<p>Humidity and temperature extremes will require of further sensor adaptation, in order to dry out or absorb the necessary humidity for their proper functioning.</p>

<p>The particle sensors measurements are delivered as averages of the two sensors with periodic validity checks. We are currently developing one-shot strategies for battery life improvement, but in the meantime, please make sure the sensor has reliable energy supply if you will use these sensors permanently.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>PM sensor has been reported to be influenced by humidity and it’s likely that humidity extremes will damage the sensor. Dust accumulation can also occur in the sensor and it has to be cleaned if working in environments with large amounts of dust.</p>

<p>The <strong>electrochemical sensor</strong> data will be processed following an <a href="/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#sensor-calibration">specific algorithm</a> accounting for temperature and humidity daily variations. This algorithm is <strong>in validation stage</strong> and will be included in the online platform flow from Smart Citizen once validated.</p>
<p>The <strong>PMS</strong> will be processed with regression techniques using referenced data, in order to improve data quality. Finally, the <strong>MOS</strong> sensors are currently being treated as qualitative measures but we are also developing <a href="/Sensor%20Analysis%20Framework/Low%20Cost%20Sensors%20Calibration/">more advanced techniques for them</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Get in contact</p>
<p>Currently we will run the algorithm manually for each station. Please, contact us once you finish the installation.</p>
</div>
<p>For processing all this data, we have developed an analysis framework that ingests the platform data and calculates all sensor results. </p>

<h2 id="power">Power<a class="headerlink" href="#power" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The kit has a battery life of 12 hours as is intended as a backup solution only. That's why a power supply needs to be installed as decribed below.</p>
<p>When we no longer want to publish or save more data for a few days we can turn off the kit. To do this, press the button for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>If the colors of the LED appear orange <span class="led small orange"> </span> indicates that the battery must be charged.</p>
<p>The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, change the orange to green <span class="led small green"> </span>.</p>
<p><em>Remember that in addition to the colors you will have the state color of the kit: configuration, network and sd.</em></p>
<h3 id="power-supply">Power supply<a class="headerlink" href="#power-supply" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The Station can be directly powered at 220V AC (Consumption MAX 33W).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Batteries</p>
<p>The Living Lab Station has a higher consumption, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors.</p>
<p>That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power.</p>
<p><em>For example, we can connect the station on the street light electric line, so the Station gets charged during the night when the lights are on.</em></p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Solar Panel</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the PV Solar Panel system to power the Station independently. The system is currently under tests, and it will be available in the next few months.</p>

<p>If the station does not respond or does not work properly you can do two things:</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Reboot your Station</p>
<p>You can fully reboot your Station by pressing the reset button located under the sensors board as seen on the picture.
That will not delete any configuration, it will simply restart your device.
Press the <code class="codehilite">RESET</code> button for a second. The light will go off and on and the device will start again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/tAofJ0g.png" /></p>
<p>You can also perform a reboot by disconnecting the battery and the USB cable so that the station is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data and configuration except the time in case of being in <strong>SD mode</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uJ0JJIb.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Factory reset your Station</p>
<p>You can fully reset the Station to the default settings so you can register again your device. Press the main button for <strong>15 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uJ0JJIb.jpg" /></p>
<p>After 5 seconds the light will go off and will go on again after 15 seconds. Then you can release the button and your device will be fully resetted as a brand new Station.</p>

<p>First of all, push the station button. Maybe it's simply off.</p>
<p>If this does not work, surely the station has been left without battery. You will have to charge it using the USB charger. Any other mobile charger will also work.</p>

<p>Prior to sensor deployment, some Living Lab Stations will be evaluated and compared against reference measurement under different conditions. They will be deployed in different cities among the iScape partners in order to assess DQO and develop models for sensor calibration under different climatic and pollution conditions. This will be done in a 2,5 months campaign in several sites across Europe.</p>
<h3 id="main-objectives">Main objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#main-objectives" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>This campaign aim to cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess data quality levels and positioning with respect to the DQO set by the European Air Quality Directive</li>
<li>Stablish match scores for the different range of sensors available in the Living Lab Station</li>
<li>Validation and assessment of Alphasense EC sensor methodology for NO2 and O3 compounds in urban conditions (urban background and traffic) in various conditions</li>
<li>Validation of PMS PM raw data accuracy and effect of climatic conditions</li>
<li>Calibration of Alphasense’s EC sensors and PMS PM sensors for model quality improvement accounting for climatic conditions</li>
<li>Feasibility assessment for the calibration of metal oxide sensor models with the use of reference data and/or Living Lab station data</li>
<li>Validation of climatic sensors of the station itself (temperature, humidity, pressure, light if possible)</li>
<li>Drifts and stability:<ul>
<li>Drifts and possible root causes for EC sensor sensitivities variations over time</li>
<li>Calibration stability for SGX MOS sensors</li>
<li>Sensor decay and recoverability of PMS sensors due to dust accumulation or others</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid direct exposure to intense sunlight for long periods of time, since this can severely affect the measurements (direct sun or intense transients).</p>
<p>Avoid locations where high temperature or humidity transients are present since the sensor response is affected by these rapid changes.</p>
<p>Avoid locations with low air flow or with direct exposure to air conditioning exhausts.</p>

iSCAPE Sensors Technical Documentation
======================================

## Introduction

The project sensor platform builds on the legacy of previous Â Smart Citizen Kit generations to develop a new set of tools especially aimed at providing meaningful data insights on a low budget. That means this report documents new components, developed specifically for the project, but frames them inside the Smart Citizen ecosystem.

We believe building modular and reusable hardware is critical towards optimizing the research and development effort. By increasing the technology readiness levels of existing technologies, we can drastically improve the project exploitation strategy.

The sensor hardware operates as a platform where new sensor modules can be shipped and deployed by the Living Labs themselves when they are finished enabling faster iterations and upgrades even after the project finishes.

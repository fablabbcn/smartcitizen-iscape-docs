Components
==========

The project sensor platform builds on the legacy of previous  Smart Citizen Kit generations to develop a new set of tools especially aimed at providing meaningful data insights on a low budget. That means this report documents new components, developed specifically for the project, but frames them inside the Smart Citizen ecosystem.

We believe building modular and reusable hardware is critical towards optimizing the research and development effort. By increasing the technology readiness levels of existing technologies, we can drastically improve the project exploitation strategy.

The sensor hardware operates as a platform where new sensor modules can be shipped and deployed by the Living Labs themselves when they are finished enabling faster iterations and upgrades even after the project finishes.

## Hardware

* [**Data Board:**](Data Board) A datalogger on asteroids and the heart of the sensors architecure supporting the [Citizen Kit](../Citizen Kit) and the [Living Lab Stations](../Living Lab Station).

	* [**Firmware:**](Firmware) The software running inside the sensors.

* **Sensor Board:** Multiple sensor board have been developed. They can be combined to built the different sensor solutions as the [Citizen Kit](../Citizen Kit) and the [Living Lab Stations](../Living Lab Station).

	* [**Urban Sensor Board:**](Urban Sensor Board) A selection of low-cost sensors in a board ready to measure the urban environment: temperature, humidity, noise and even PM2.5. Together with the [Data Board](Data Board) they create the [Citizen Kit](../Citizen Kit).

	* [**PM Sensor Board:**](PM Sensor Board) An auxiliary board capable of driving two Particulate Matter sensor as well as other auxiliary sensors required for specific deployments as an external temperature sensor or an anemometer. It is used in the [Living Lab Stations](../Living Lab Station).

	* [**Gas Pro Sensor Board:**](Gas Pro Sensor Board) An auxiliary board driving 3 Alphasense Ltd. Electrochemical Series B Gas Sensors designed for ultra-low noise, high-performance and low power operation. It is used in the [Living Lab Stations](../Living Lab Station).

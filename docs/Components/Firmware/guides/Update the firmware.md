When new features are developed or bugs are fixed we will release new versions of the SCK firmware.

!!! example "Updating your kit is very simple"

	1. **Connect your kit** with a micro USB cable to your computer.

	2. **Double click the reset button** of your SCK, the SCK led should turn green and a new drive called _SCK-20_ should appear on your computer file browser.

	3. Inside the _SCK-20_ drive you should see some files, **double click the _INDEX.HTM_** file and our  [github releases page](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-kit-20/releases/latest) will open in your browser. **Download the new firmware** called _SAM_firmware_XXX.uf2_ and save it to your computer.

	!!! tip
		You can backup your current firmware version just saving the file called _CURRENT.UF2_.


	4. Simply **drag the firmware file you downloaded over the _SCK-20_ drive**, your kit led will blink in green and after some seconds it will reset and start with the new version.

	5. After the update you just done, when your SCK gets connected to the network it will **check for an updated versi√≥n of the wifi chip (ESP8266) firmware**. If there is a new version your SCK will update automatically.

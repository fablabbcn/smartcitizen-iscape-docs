### Control digital potentiometers

The Living Lab Station, formerly known as the High-End Sensors,  is aimed at providing the Living Labs with a system for monitoring the performance of their interventions. The Station aims at providing a solution that can be used by the Living Labs not just from a scientific point of view but also as a tool to engage local communities on air pollution related issues.

The station is designed with a modular principle where sensors can be added easily added expanding the capabilities of the installation or replaced when they are damaged or the sensors lifetime is over. From a costs perspective while being more expensive than the Citizen Kit it is also conceived as a low-cost solution. That allows to guarantee at least four stations will be available for each Living Lab to increase the spatial resolution and reliability of the measurements.

The design builds on top of the Citizen Kit adding an extra set of more accurate sensors especially aimed at measuring air pollutants. The sensors include the Gas Sensor Board, featuring EC Carbon Monoxide, Dioxide Nitrogen and Ozone sensors and the PM Sensor Board, featuring a PM 2.5 / PM 10 sensor.

With all the sensor together this Kit provides information on Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, Ambient Light, Barometric Pressure, Particles Matter (PM 2.5 / 10),  Carbon Monoxide, Dioxide Nitrogen and Ozone. The sensors are later described in detail in the document at the Sensor Components section.

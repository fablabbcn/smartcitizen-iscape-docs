iSCAPE Sensors Technical Documentation
======================================

## Introduction

The project sensor platform builds on the legacy of previous Â Smart Citizen Kit generations to develop a new set of tools especially aimed at providing meaningful data insights on a low budget. That means this report documents new components, developed specifically for the project, but frames them inside the Smart Citizen ecosystem.

We believe building modular and reusable hardware is critical towards optimizing the research and development effort. By increasing the technology readiness levels of existing technologies, we can drastically improve the project exploitation strategy.

Environmental sensors play a critical role in the ISCAPE project the
primary goals being:

* Engage local communities at the Living Labs to deploy and learn about sensors as a novel way to learn about their environment, in particular cities air pollution issues.

* Provide a sensor infrastructure to enable the different sites to monitor the performance of their interventions.

To support this approach, we needed to accomplish three key
requirements:

* **Modularity:** The sensor hardware operates as a platform where new sensor modules can be shipped and deployed by the Living Labs themselves when they are finished enabling faster iterations and upgrades even after the project finishes.

* **Open design and documentation:** All the components developed are released on open source license to foster the collaboration between different the stakeholders. That especially aims at involving the Living Labs on the design of new sensing strategies and technologies.

* **Easy to use:** The technology needs to be accessible to ensure users engagement, especially for those sensors targeting at citizens, but also to ensure the technology development is ready to be exploded commercially after the project.

The following approach led the project to development of two sensor solutions: The **Citizen Kit** and the **Living Lab Station**.

<p>The sensor comes mounted and almost ready to be used</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/GfQy84y.jpg" /></p>
<p>The only thing we should do is connect the battery. The kit will light in red and we will be able to configure it by following the instructions at <a href="https://attention.smartcitizen.me"><strong>onboarding.iscape.smartcitizen.me</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5mjUhWr.png" /></p>
<p>After the configuration your data will be available on the SmartCitizen platform. You can explore the data there or download it using the <code class="codehilite">CSV Download</code> option.</p>

<p>The kit has a battery life of 12 hours. For long exposures, we can permanently connect to the USB.</p>
<p>When we no longer want to publish or save more data for a few days we can turn off the kit. To do this, press the button for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>If the colors of the LED appear orange <span class="led small orange"> </span> indicates that the battery must be charged.</p>
<p>The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, change the orange to green <span class="led small green"> </span>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/RxD960s.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="✅" class="emojione" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/2705.svg" title=":white_check_mark:" /> The kit supports Wi-Fi WEP, WPA/WPA2 and open networks that are common networks in domestic environments and small businesses.</p>
<p><img alt="❎" class="emojione" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/274e.svg" title=":negative_squared_cross_mark:" /> On the other hand, it does not support WPA/WPA2 Enterprise networks such as EDUROAM or networks with captive portals such as those found in Airports and Hotels</p>

<p>If we do not have an internet connection we can use the SD mode. In this case the device will record the data on the micro SD card. Later we can read the card using a card reader. The data can be visually spaced in a spreadsheet but also published on the <a href="https://smartcitizen.me"><strong>smartcitizen.me</strong></a> platform using the <strong>UPLOAD CSV</strong> option.</p>

<h3 id="1-before-setup">1. Before setup<a class="headerlink" href="#1-before-setup" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Before configuring the Kit setup make sure the LED is red. If not, press the button multiple times until the LED turns red.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/9iK1ZLl.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="2-the-kit-does-not-respond">2. The kit does not respond<a class="headerlink" href="#2-the-kit-does-not-respond" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>If the kit does not respond or does not work properly you can do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restart</strong> Disconnect the battery and the USB cable so that the kit is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data and configuration except the time in case of being in <strong>SD mode</strong>. For this reason, if we are using this mode, we must use the mobile phone again to reactivate the SD mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uWJHCyr.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reset completely</strong> By pressing the button for 15 seconds, any configuration will be cleared from the kit. It will be necessary to go back to the configuration process. This process can be combined with the process above.</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all, push the kit button. Maybe it's simply off.</p>
<p>If this does not work, surely the kit has been left without battery. You will have to charge it using the USB charger. Any other mobile charger will also work.</p>
<p>We will know that it is charging when the LED emits <span class="led orange blink"></span> orange pulses and once the battery is charged it will emit green <span class = "led green blink"> </ span></p>

<p>Some SD cards may have problems over time. We can try <a href="">formatting it</a> but in case it does not work any micro SD card we buy at any mobile or computer store it will work. The size is not important and any micro SD or micro SDHC 512MB card up to 32GB will work.</p>
<h2 id="csv-upload">CSV Upload<a class="headerlink" href="#csv-upload" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Here some instructions on how to upload CSV files to Smartcitizen platform. First be sure to be logged and go to your <a href="https://smartcitizen.me/profile/kits">profile</a>.</p>
<p>On your kits' list, click on the wheel and then on <code class="codehilite">Upload CSV</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/gyMgl5n.png" /></p>
<p>Once on the upload page, you can add some files by clicking on the <code class="codehilite">Load CSV files</code> button.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/98bcwRj.png" /></p>
<p>Select some files as much as you like, to be them ready to upload. Then on the drop-down menu select the <code class="codehilite">Upload</code> option</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/V6LEqrz.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the <code class="codehilite">Apply</code> button to upload them</p>

<p>The Citizen Kit, formerly known as the Low-Cost Sensor, is aimed at providing a low-cost environmental sensor solution non-technical users can easily deploy. The design developed for the project is a complete reiteration of the  Smart Citizen Kit, a piece of hardware for citizen sensing already tested in other projects for more than five years. On this iteration, new sensors had been added, and all the electronic design has been redone from the ground up to improve the data accuracy and reduce the manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>The design is built around two boards the Smart Citizen Data Board and the Smart Citizen Urban Sensor Board. The first board contains the data acquisition, the power management, and the communication unit. The second contains a set of sensors aimed at the outdoor urban environment including: Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, Ambient Light and Barometric Pressure. The board also features a section especially focused on Air Quality including a Air Particles, a Carbon Monoxide, and a Nitrogen Dioxide detectors. This sensor while not capable of offering precise measurements can be used to understand the behavior of different urban locations especially when they are calibrated on the field using certified equipment. Both boards are later described in detail on the Sensor Components section.</p>

<p>The Citizen Kit is a modular system based on different sensor board that connected to a central datalogger.</p>

<p>Our online onboarding website guides you through the assembly and configuration process. You’ll need a computer with an internet connection to start using the SCK 2.0.</p>
<h6 id="software-updates">Software Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#software-updates" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h6>
<p>The SCK 2.0 has two components that need periodic updates. The SCK 2.0 appears as a USB Storage device and the new firmware can be installed on your kit by simply downloading the new firmware release and then dragging and dropping into the SCK 2.0 device root folder. The Wi-Fi module firmware is updated automatically over-the-air every time the main processor firmware is updated.</p>

Test4 Link PyMdown Extensions Link PyMdown Extensions is a collection of Markdown extensions that add some great features to the standard Markdown library. For this reason, the installation of this package is highly recommended as it's well-integrated with the Material theme. Installation Link The PyMdown Extensions package can be installed with the following command: pip install pymdown-extensions The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with the Material theme: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem : smart_enable : all - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist : custom_checkbox : true - pymdownx.tilde Usage Link Arithmatex MathJax Link Arithmatex integrates Material with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This must be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime in extra_javascript which contains your MathJax configuration, e.g.: window . MathJax = { tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \\\\( , \\\\) ] ], displayMath : [ [ \\\\[ , \\\\] ] ] }, TeX : { TagSide : right , TagIndent : .8em , MultLineWidth : 85% , equationNumbers : { autoNumber : AMS , }, unicode : { fonts : STIXGeneral, Arial Unicode MS } }, displayAlign : left , showProcessingMessages : false , messageStyle : none }; In your mkdocs.yml , include it with: extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML Blocks Link Blocks are enclosed in $$ ... $$ which are placed on separate lines. Example: $$ \\frac {n ! }{k !( n - k )! } = \\binom {n}{k} $$ Result: \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline Link Inline equations need to be enclosed in $ ... $ : Example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} BetterEm Link BetterEm improves the handling of emphasis markup ( bold and italic ) within Markdown by providing a more sophisticated parser for better detecting start and end tokens. Read the documentation for usage notes . Caret Link Caret makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Critic Link Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Details Link Details adds collapsible Admonition-style blocks which can contain arbitrary content using the HTML5 details and summary tags. Additionally, all Admonition qualifiers can be used, e.g. note , question , warning etc.: How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? Yes. Emoji Link Emoji adds the ability to insert a -load of emojis that we use in our daily lives. See the EmojiOne demo for a list of all available emojis. Happy scrolling Legal disclaimer Material has no affiliation with EmojiOne which is released under CC BY 4.0 . When including EmojiOne images or CSS, please read the EmojiOne license to ensure proper usage and attribution. InlineHilite Link InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting. It's useful for short snippets included within body copy, e.g. var test = 0 ; and can be achived by prefixing inline code with a shebang and language identifier, e.g. #!js . MagicLink Link MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses. Mark Link Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols Link SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows ( , , ), trademark and copyright symbols ( , , ) and fractions ( , , ...). SuperFences Link SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. SuperFences does also allow grouping code blocks with tabs . Tasklist Link Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde Link Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text.

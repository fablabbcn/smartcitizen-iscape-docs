<p>The following data analysis framework is built on Python 2.7 and Jupyter Notebooks. Here we will show you how to install it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dowload and Install Anaconda for Python 2.7 <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data">Github</a> to download the project folder or simply use <code class="codehilite">git</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the <strong>Anaconda Navigator</strong> app and launch the <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Do you have already a Python environment you use for other work and you are worried about updating some packages?</em></p>
<p><strong>Conda</strong> can load a dedicated environment for you to run <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jupyter</strong> based on the <code class="codehilite">environment.yml</code> configuration file we provide.</p>
<p>Open your favourite shell on the directory you have your project. <em>(<code class="codehilite">cmd.exe</code> on windows)</em> </p>
<p>Run the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This will install and load the Python environment we prepared for iSCAPE</p>
<p><code class="codehilite">conda env create -f environment.yml</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now activate the environment</p>
<p><code class="codehilite">source activate iscape</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready, run to run Jupyter</p>
<p><code class="codehilite">jupyter notebook</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want to install <strong>Anaconda</strong> you can install all the dependencies manually. Just follow the steps above:</p>
<h4 id="install-python">Install Python<a class="headerlink" href="#install-python" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Python is the main programming language we will use for Data Analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows download and run the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">installer</a> for Python 2.7</li>
<li>Mac cames directly with python built in. However you can install the latest version using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Hombrew</a> and then run <code class="codehilite">$ brew install python</code></li>
<li>On Linux simply use your distribution package manager like <code class="codehilite">$ apt</code> in Debian or Ubuntu. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="install-pip">Install Pip<a class="headerlink" href="#install-pip" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Pip is the packet manager Python uses and it comes installed by default. If you have any issues you can download pip <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">here</a>. </p>
<h4 id="installl-jupyter">Installl Jupyter<a class="headerlink" href="#installl-jupyter" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks allows us to quickly learn, develop and improve our tools by providing a common convenient framework and UI. </p>
<p>Simply run <code class="codehilite">pip install jupyter</code> on your terminal to install it.</p>
<h4 id="download-the-source">Download the source<a class="headerlink" href="#download-the-source" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data">Download</a> from Github or simply use <code class="codehilite">git</code></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data.git
</pre></div>

<h4 id="run-the-notebook">Run the notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#run-the-notebook" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>On your terminal go to the folder where tou downloaded your files and then run <code class="codehilite">jupyter notebook</code> this will open a new webpage and you will be available to run your code there.</p>

<p>The stations data can be fully processed within the <a href="https://docs.iscape.smartcitizen.me/Sensor%20Analysis%20Framework/">sensor analysis framework</a> provided. In this guide, we will go through a working <em>live</em> example that will use available data from a permanent living lab station in <strong>Fablab BCN</strong>. The available sensors are listed <a href="https://docs.iscape.smartcitizen.me/Living%20Lab%20Station/">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="load-in-the-data">Load in the data<a class="headerlink" href="#load-in-the-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>So first, we will load in the data from this station. The device number is the <strong>4748</strong>, and is available in <a href="https://smartcitizen.me/kits/4748">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will use the available interface in our <em>framework</em> to load the station data. In this case, we will load all the available data into our notebook, but if we wanted, we could use the interface to set up time limits, should the timeframe desired be different:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TIkpY72.png" /></p>
<div class="admonition info">

<p>In the field <em>Kit list</em> we can also input a comma separated list of devices such as: <code class="codehilite">4748, 4565, 4587</code> and we will load all the data for you.</p>
</div>
<p>We can now explore the available readings in our test with something like:</p>

<p>Note that each of these fields is necessary for our posterior calculations. Each of the <code class="codehilite">O3</code>, <code class="codehilite">NO~2~</code>, <code class="codehilite">CO</code> fields relate to the manufacturer's reference of each of the sensors, whilst the <code class="codehilite">SLOTS</code> field relates to the order at which the sensors are placed. <strong>Normally</strong>, the stations are delivered with the SLOTS field as: <code class="codehilite">(&#39;CO&#39;, &#39;NO~2~&#39;, &#39;O3&#39;)</code>, meaning that the <em>CO sensor</em> is in the slot #1, the <em>NO<sub>2</sub> sensor</em> in the slot #2 and the <em>O3 sensor</em> in the slot #3.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>Normally we refer to the OX-B431 sensor as O3, although it measures both, O3+NO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratios, and therefore we use O3 or OX indistinctively.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the slots we have input are not matching to our own description... Our bad!</p>
</div>
<h4 id="explore-the-data">Explore the data<a class="headerlink" href="#explore-the-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>We can now have a look at the station's data. We can go to the Section <code class="codehilite">Exploratory Data Analysis</code> and use the range of available interfaces for the data analysis. We would like to serve this as a flexible tool, in which the priority is to generate proper analysis. For this, we have some interesting interactive plots as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time Series Plot</li>
<li>Back2Back correlation plots</li>
<li>Correlogram</li>
<li>Heat maps</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's run a simple example. We will plot all the concerned <code class="codehilite">alphasense</code> signals using the interface. We could also do this by code, but we find it less time consuming and more data analysis dedicated:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TTfFF9w.png" /></p>
<p>We can select within the channels available in the dataframe, for each of the devices within a test. All the devices are supossed to have overlapping timestamps, so they can be compared easily. Hence, here is where the concept of test is interesting, since all the devices within a test can be easily grouped and compared:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/R4fK2cX.png" /></p>
<p>In this example we have selected all three alphasense sensors available data  and plotted them with the working and auxiliary electrodes. We can here explore with the <a href="http://plot.ly">plotly</a> integrated commands to review the data.</p>
<p>Here, it is important to see how the <strong>sensors adapt to the environment</strong> once they have their power restored after a power cut, or after the first use. For example, in the case of the <code class="codehilite">CO</code> measurement, after the power restorage on 31<sup>st</sup> of August, the sensor is clearly experiencing an stabilisation that has to be discarded in our calculations:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/GyG1KbL.jpg" /></p>
<p>We can also see how some metrics correlate among themselves and analyse potential sources for multicollinearity in our model. For this, we will study how every two measurments correlate among themselves in the following interface:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/s5CYIDW.png" /></p>
<p>We will use a very straightforward example: let's see how temperature and relative humidity correlate and see if there might be variations in the absolute humidity that might affect the variations in the relative humidity that are not explained by the temperature. If we select our channels and <em>Check</em> on <code class="codehilite">Crop Data in X axis</code> and input our dates we will have the following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZS7Xnfs.png" /></p>
<p>Here, we can see that both are anticorrelated (Pearson = -0.61) and although they have a clear inverse trend, their R2 is low:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/lvWtVUq.png" /></p>
<p>This might indicate that the variations in the humidity are not fully explained by the temperature variations and, that there might be variations in the absolute humidity that we could account for in our models.</p>
<h4 id="adding-calculated-channels">Adding calculated channels<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-calculated-channels" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Let's then add the partial vapour pressure in our dataset. Based on the definition of the relative humidity (RH):</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
RH ( \% )= 100 {P_{H2O} \over P^*_{H2O}}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
RH ( \% )= 100 {P_{H2O} \over P^*_{H2O}}
</script>
</div>
<p>Where <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">P_{H_2O}</span><script type="math/tex">P_{H_2O}</script></span> is the partial vapour pressure and <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">P^*_{H_2O}</span><script type="math/tex">P^*_{H_2O}</script></span> is the equilibrium vapour pressure at a certain pressure and temperature. This equilibrium vapour pressure can be determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity#Measurement">Arden Buck Equation</a> and goes like:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
P^*_{H2O} (mbar) = (1,0007+3,46x10^{-6}xP)x6.1121e^{17,520T/(240,97+T)}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
P^*_{H2O} (mbar) = (1,0007+3,46x10^{-6}xP)x6.1121e^{17,520T/(240,97+T)}
</script>
</div>
<p>Where <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">P</span><script type="math/tex">P</script></span> is the absolute pressure in mbar and <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">T</span><script type="math/tex">T</script></span> is the temperature in degC. Having the partial vapour pressure, we can then calculate both values in the implemented calculator in our notebook:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/iz29E8Y.png" /></p>
<p>Here, the formula is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">## Calculate equilibrium vapour pressure</span>
<span class="n">P_H2O_EQ</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1.0007</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">3.46</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mf">1e-6</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">PRESS</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mf">6.1121</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">17.502</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">TEMP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">240.97</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">TEMP</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that we can input any type of expression in the <code class="codehilite">Formula Field</code> that can be subject to evaluation as in a Python formula. Note as well that <code class="codehilite">numpy</code> operations are allowed and that they can be written in line.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>If you want to calculate this formula for several devices within a test, select all of them and the calculator will make the available in the dropdowns the common metrics.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, we can calculate de partial vapour pressure as, since it's available within our channels:</p>

We can now verify that the partial pressure is not constant and plotting it with the other channels:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/E8SRwJk.png" /></p>
<p>If we analyse the data in periods where the partial vapour pressure is fairly constant (i.e. 31<sup>st</sup> of Aug, we see that variations of the temperature are directly correlated with the relative humidity, whilst days as the 2<sup>nd</sup> of September show greater variations in both, temperature and partial vapour pressure that provoke a lower correlation in the temperature and humidity:</p>

<p>Now that we know how to get around in the notebook, explore data and add channels in a simple way, lets calculate actual pollutant concentrations. For this, we will use the section <code class="codehilite">AlphaSense Baseline Calibration</code>. In this block, we will apply the methodology exlained in <a href="https://docs.iscape.smartcitizen.me/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors/">this section</a> in order to calculate actual pollutant concentrations.</p>
<p>For this, in the above mentioned section, if we run the cell, we will see an output like the following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Zg8qtRa.png" /></p>
<p>This will list all the available devices that contain alphasense data. Remember to include the calibration data mentioned before in the <code class="codehilite">dict</code> so that we can calculate the final concentrations.</p>
<p>For reference, all the alphasense data is under <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data/blob/master/calData/AlphaSense.json">this repository</a>, which looks like:</p>

<p>In the cell output, we can select the tests that contain alphasense devices and that are subject to be calculated. A brief explanation of all the checkboxes is detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Decomp</em>: attemps to decompose the trends found in the day-to-day data. This is a common technique used in time series analysis in order to avoid regression including trend. It is normally not needed since the periods that are used for the data calculacions are short enough to have no significant trend (one day + overlap*)</li>
<li><em>Plots Inter</em>: checking this plots intermediary plots of all the calculations performed within the method. Use with caution</li>
<li><em>Verbose</em>: checking this includes extra information during the calculation process. Use with caution</li>
<li><em>Plots Results</em>: plots the final calculation per pollutant and all relevant intermediary calculation. Default is to be Checked</li>
<li><em>Print Stats</em>: prints interesting statistics about the dataset for later use</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's calculate the pollutants. We don't need to worry about the manufacturer data, since it will automatically retrieved during the process.</p>
<p><strong>CO results</strong></p>
<p>The methodology used here is not the baseline model, but the application of this formula, as explained in <a href="https://docs.iscape.smartcitizen.me/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#application-on-4-electrode-sensors">here</a>:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
Concentration \ [ppm] = {I_{WE}-n(I_{AE}) \ [nA] \over Sensitivity \ [nA/ ppm]}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Concentration \ [ppm] = {I_{WE}-n(I_{AE}) \ [nA] \over Sensitivity \ [nA/ ppm]}
</script>
</div>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5EmpUhK.png" /></p>
<p>As we can see, the initial data is not to be considered due to the sensor stabilisation time. If we focus on the usable data, we can already get some insights about what hours are more polluted and the difference between working days and weekends:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/H9suXGA.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>NO<sub>2</sub> results</strong></p>
<p>For this metric, we will be using the above mentioned baseline methodology</p>
<p>If we have a look at the data, we see that the sensor still requires stabilisation, as the CO electrode:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/CVIYfua.jpg" /></p>
<p>Zooming in, we can see the most polluted hours are those in the morning:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/p0zohNs.jpg" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>OX sensor in this station is not giving good results (probably it's ageing has provoked a sensitivity loss), and therefore, the data will not be shown here.</p>

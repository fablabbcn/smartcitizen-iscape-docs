<p>The purpose of this test is to determine the time needed to obtain representative readings in a one-shot mode.</p>
<p>For this, two kits V2.0 are used with several PM Boards and <strong>one</strong> PMS5003 connected to each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>KIT1: Named OSCAR + 1xPMS5003</li>
<li>KIT2: Named TEST7 + 1xPMS5003</li>
</ul>
<p>One of them is set in a continuous operation mode, while the other operates in on/off mode with different on-times.</p>
<p><strong>TEST</strong>:

<ol>
<li>Although the PMS has a faster response at high PN, the variability and the measurement averages are higher as well. <strong>This can also be due to the measurement method uncertainty</strong></li>
<li>For low PN, the time required for stabilisation is between 12 and 15s, to achieve a level of 95% confidence with respect to that of stabilised levels</li>
<li>The target time should be 15s, although lower values could be considered down to 12s if there are battery concerns</li>

<p><strong>Connect the board</strong></p>
<p>The alphaDelta board should be connected to the kit auxiliary groove connector and the tester board to the alphaDelta. In this way the kit will have acces to both boards writing values in tester board and reading them in the sensor board.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/MqFyvDm.png" /></p>
<p>The tester board should be connected between Electrodes <strong>A</strong> and <strong>W</strong> from the slot you want to test.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5hJTQIw.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Get the firmware</strong></p>
<p>You will need the latest version of SCK 2.0 Firmware. To enable tester board in firmware uncomment <code class="codehilite">#define deltaTest</code> in <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-kit-15/blob/master/sam/src/sckAux.h#L10">sckAux.h</a> file compile and upload the firmware.</p>

<p>The tester board is enabled as a <em>control</em> command of Alphasense Delta sensors, so it must be called with the prefix <strong>control</strong> then the name of the sensor <strong>alpha</strong> (fuzzy match is supported) then the <strong>test</strong> keyword followed by the slot number we want to test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>control alpha test 1</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To complete the line we should select one of the two test modes:</p>
<p><strong>set</strong> followed by a nA value between -1400/+1400. This will instruct the tester board to output that current and verify the readings of the sensor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>control alpha test <slot> set <value></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>SCK &gt; control alpha test 1 set 500

or <strong>full</strong> that will ouput a csv formated table with the values for both electrodes of the selected slot from -1400 nA to 1400 nA:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-run-the-validation">How to run the validation?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-run-the-validation" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>For validating the boards, we propose verifying that: <strong>each nA input can only yield a single output in mV in the ADC, at minimum gain (for each electrode).</strong></p>
<p>This means that for a test such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>control alpha test 1 full</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should obtain an always positively growing value in the readW, readA channels. For this, we have to check that:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
\delta[n] = readX[n]-readX[n-1]&gt;0
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\delta[n] = readX[n]-readX[n-1]>0
</script>
</div>
<p>If we plot all this results we see that they are normally over 0.1 for all the boards, so we use this value as a minimum threshold, instead of zero:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
\delta[n] = readX[n]-readX[n-1]&gt;0.1
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\delta[n] = readX[n]-readX[n-1]>0.1
</script>
</div>
<p>Finally, this test is also valid for <strong>too high gains</strong> since once the signal is saturated the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\delta</span><script type="math/tex">\delta</script></span> value is 0 (saturates in a flat plateau).</p>

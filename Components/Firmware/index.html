<p>The firmware is OOP and is entirely written in C++. Both processors the core ARM MCU and the ESP8266 WIFI are developed as part of the same framework integrating seemingly by using a set of bridge libraries that provide a unifies the RPC architecture.</p>
<p>The follo software was partially developed by IAAC as part of the Making Sense project under the European Community's H2020 Programme Grant Agreement No. 688620.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/aDfydqU.png" /></p>
<p>Firmware updates are done via the micro USB port using the Platform IO software available for Linux, Mac and Windows. </p>

<h2 id="data-management">Data management<a class="headerlink" href="#data-management" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The board is capable of storing the recorded data offline on its internal dedicated flash memory of 8MB and later publish this over Wi-Fi connectivity provided by an Espressif ESP8266. Data is published using MQTT messages to the Smart Citizen Platform. NTP is used for syncing the built-in RTC. For long term offline storage, the board provides a standard microSD socket where card in the orders of GB can be employed. That ensures extended periods of data in the order of decades can be stored.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The board firmware is fully customizable without requiring any changes to the core software. That includes enabling or disabling sensors, the sampling frequency of the sensors or the operation mode. There different configuration options: via the Serial Shell available when the board is connected over USB, editing the config.txt file when using a microSD card.</p>

<p><em>Use any Serial console as <code class="codehilite">screen</code>, <code class="codehilite">platformio device monitor</code>, or the serial monitor on the Arduino IDE</em></p>
<p>Example commands:</p>

<h3 id="configuration-file-configtxt">Configuration file <strong>CONFIG.TXT</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-file-configtxt" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>If this file doesn't exist it is generated by the kit with the factory defaults and after that it can be modified by both the user and the kit. <code class="codehilite"><span class="nt">SckBase</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">resetConfigFile</span><span class="o">();</span></code></p>
<p>If the modification comes from the kit (sound, platform, etc) it should be saved to the flash and then to the SD.</p>
<p>When the file is read from the SD if it is valid and different from the flash version the flash version should be updated. There is a problem in this approach: if the user insert and old scard with an old config without erasing it he can mess an newly configured kit. To solve this there is the possibility of having a first entry in the config file that is called something like <em>user_modified</em> and the user should modify this so the new config is loaded. If this flag is not true the sdcard config would be overwritten with the one in the flash.</p>

<p>When a SD is detected this file will be synced with the flash version as the correct one. For this to work we need a fast way to compare the files. We need to test if this is doable in terms of speed. Maybe only do this when it is requested via a command or user input.</p>
<p>There should be a way to know if a post has been uploaded to the platform, so when the kit doesn't have a wifi connection it saves the readings and publish them as soon as a network connection is available.</p>

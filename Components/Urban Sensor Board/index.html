<p>The Urban Sensor Board contains a selection of sensors for the measuring the urban outdoor environment. The sensor selection is based on the recommendations provided by ISCAPE WP1 among the experience acquired from previous Smart Citizen Kit generations.</p>

<p>A major effort has been carried out on this design to improve the accuracy of the data provided. The sensors on the board include: Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, Ambient Light and Barometric Pressure. The board also features a section especially focused on Air Quality including a Particles Matter, a Carbon Monoxide and a Dioxide Nitrogen detectors. The sensor density of the board design offers more than ten different environmental metrics at a cost below 50€ and differentiates the design from other existing solutions. The following sections describe in detail each of the sensors available.</p>

<h2 id="metal-oxide-no2-and-co-sensor">Metal Oxide NO<sub>2</sub> and CO Sensor<a class="headerlink" href="#metal-oxide-no2-and-co-sensor" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The SGX Sensortech (formerly e2v) MICS 4514 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>is a dual, robust MEMS sensor for the detection of pollution from automobile exhausts. It integrates on a single SMD package the more well-known SGX MICS 5525 for Carbon Monoxide detection and the SGX MICS 2710 for Dioxide Nitrogen detection. The sensor includes two sensor chips with independent heaters and sensitive layers. One sensor chip detects Oxidizing gases (OX) primarily NO<sub>2</sub> in a 0.05-10ppm, and the other sensor detects reducing gases (RED) primarily NO<sub>2</sub> in a 1-1000ppm.</p>
<p>The following characteristics have been considered for the sensor choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Combines in the same package both the CO and NO<sub>2</sub> sensors in a low-cost unit \&lt;15€</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low heating current, especially important since the sensor can be battery-powered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wide range gas concentration detection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensive operational temperature range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robust to vibrations and shocks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The MICS-4514 Carbon Monoxide detection performance was tested by <em>(Rai et al. 2017; Spinelle et al. 2017)</em> under field conditions. They reported good agreement (R2 = 0.76--0.78) between sensor response and reference measurements when it was calibrated by using simple or multiple linear regression models <em>(Rai et al. 2017)</em></p>
<p>The sensor integration on the Urban Sensor Board features an analog front-end different than those used by other products using the same sensor to achieve more precise and stable readings. That includes a dynamic gaining circuit and an adjustable heating system designed from the ground up for this application.</p>
<p>However, the baseline resistance can vary a lot from sensor to sensor, and according to the measuring conditions, which is why the manufacturer recommends monitoring the sensitivity periodically. That mean re-calibration of the device after a few months might be required because the pairs of metal-oxide on the surface of the captor change their physical properties when exposed to the detectable gases. That is the primary reason the Living Lab Station include an extra Gas Sensor Board featuring three pre calibrated EC gas sensors to provide more precise and meaningful air quality data.</p>

<p>Ultra Low Cost when compared to other commercial solutions with similar performance</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The selection is based on the academic references selected above. For a complete Low-Cost Sensors Evaluation see ISCAPE D1.5 Summary of air quality sensors and recommendations for application and the subsequent publication <em>(Rai et al. 2017)</em>.</p>
<p>Compliance with the NAAQS (US National Ambient Air Quality Standards) is based on 24-h PM mass concentrations [...] Both of the FEM instruments correlate with the 24-h PM2.5 mass measurements with an R2 > 0.99. The PMS PM2.5 concentrations are also well correlated with the 24-h mass average concentration (R2 > 0.88), which is slightly better than the GRIMM research-grade instrument (R2 1⁄4 0.7.). South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) recently published preliminary comparisons of the PM2.5 measurements from three PMS 1003s and two FEMs, with high correlations (R2 > 0.9) over a 2-month period. This study demonstrated that the PMS 1003/3003 correlates well with FRMs, FEMs, and research-grade instrumentation under ambient conditions during a series of cold-air pools and in a wind-tunnel environment. Under ambient conditions, this sensor correlates better with an FRM than other low-cost sensors in similar studies. [...] these sensors are a promising tool for identifying relative increases or decreases in PM concentration, complementing sparsely distributed monitoring stations and for assessing and minimizing exposure to PM <em>(Kelly et al. 2017)</em>.</p>
